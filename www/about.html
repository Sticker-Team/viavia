        <h1>About Viavia</h1>
			<p>
				Viavia is an app with the goal to help students who are attending the university but are not from the local area.
				<br>
				<br>
				By using Viavia they will be able to access info about where they need to go and what they need to do in the city to help them with everyday necessities eg. Groceries or public transport
				<br/>
				<br>
				the information is presented to them in the form of a game so as to be easier to learn through multiple intelligence as both halves of the brain will be working.The right(creative) side of the brain will be focused on the game while the left(logical) side will be working on learning the information.
				<br>
				<br>
				By using this technique we hope to aid students in their first few weeks of college away from home.
